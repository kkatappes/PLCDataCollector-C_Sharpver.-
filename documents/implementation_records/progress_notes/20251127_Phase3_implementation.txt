# Phase3 Implementation Progress - 2025-11-27

## Implementation Targets
1. AsyncExceptionHandler - Hierarchical exception handling
2. CancellationCoordinator - Cancellation coordination
3. ResourceSemaphoreManager - Shared resource exclusive control
4. ProgressReporter - Progress reporting
5. ParallelExecutionController - Parallel execution control

## TDD Methodology
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle strict adherence
- Test-first development
- Minimum implementation for passing tests
- Continuous refactoring

## Starting Point
- All 5 classes are empty (skeleton only)
- Interfaces are defined but have TODO comments
- Class design specifications confirmed in documents/design/クラス設計.md (lines 1893-2039)

## Next Steps
1. Start with AsyncExceptionHandler as first implementation target
2. Define interface methods based on design specification
3. Write tests first (Red)
4. Implement minimum code to pass tests (Green)
5. Refactor while maintaining test passage (Refactor)
